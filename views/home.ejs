  <h4>So what is this all about?</h4>
  <p>Most people agree that meetings tend to be underproductive. Many individuals fail to prepare properly for a meeting and usually there's always some douche asking stupid questions.</p>
  <p>The main point is that <strong>meetings take more time than is needed</strong>, and an extra half hour wasted in a meeting of ten is actually five hours lost. And meetings are the worst kind of interruptions because they make people lose momentum at work.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately meetings are a necessary evil, <strong>Meetoring is here to help you minimize that evil by monitoring your meetings</strong>.</p>
